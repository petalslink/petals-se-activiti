# petals-se-activiti

Following the major event about Activiti project occurring in October 2016, the creation of fork Flowable, we
decides to join this new project Flowable migrating our BPMN 2.0 service engine to this branch.

That's why this project is no more maintenained, and has been replaced by Petals SE Flowable available
